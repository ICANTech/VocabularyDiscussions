#ICAN Water Quality Global Thesaurus#

Dear All,

At the recent ICAN-5 meeting in Ostend it was decided to extend the semantic coverage of the ICAN pilot project into other areas.  One of these was water quality. To set this rolling, the attached PDF is a straw-man concept map for the 'global thesaurus'.  This has equivalent functionality to the coastal erosion global thesaurus (http://vocab.ndg.nerc.ac.uk/list/A01).

The thesaurus has 15 target terms (terms to which local vocabulary concepts are mapped) plus a small hierarchical classification (green boxes). The concepts have mostly been lifted from the EEA Gemet thesaurus.

Is this the kind of thing people require?  In particular, are there concepts in local vocabularies that cannot be mapped. If so, what are they? Any other comments on what has been included (or excluded!).

One possibility would be to build a local vocabulary of SeaDataNet/EMONET terms and map them as part of the NETMAR D3.6 work.  This would pave the way for EMODNET chemical lot data products being made available to ICAN.  Anyone any feelings on whether or not this work should be undertaken?

I appreciate a lot of the ICAN community are still on ICAN-5 travels and so don't plan to take this any further forward until October to provide ample time for feedback.

Cheers, Roy.
