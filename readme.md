#ICAN Vocabulary Discussions#
##Introduction##
This Github repository is to allow discussion of various controlled vocabulary related topics by the International Coastal Atlas Network (ICAN) community.

Previous discussions, by e-mail, are in the process of being archived within this repository as markdown files to be rendered by GitHub.

New discussions should take place within the wiki space associated with this repository.

##ICAN Vocabulary Content Governance##
The ICAN Technical Committee is the content governance body for the controlled vocabularies developed by ICAN.

In practice, this means that requests for new controlled vocabularies to be devleoped by ICAN, or additonal content for existing ICAN-goverened controlled vocabularies,  must be approved by the technical Committee.

In order to request a new vocabulary, please open a new Github issue against this repository detailing your request. This enables a fully transparent discussion to take place and it remains visisble even when marked as closed.

A standing agenda item will be added to the ICAN Technical Committee's virtual meetings (which take place approximately once a month) to review the vocabulary discussion issues and to take appropriate follow-up actoin on any requested vocabularies or terms.

Current vocabularies under ICAN Technical Committee governnace include:

- [International Coastal Atlas Network Coastal Erosion Global Thesaurus](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/A01/current/)

In due course, the Wiki associated with this repository will be updated to hold information on discussions, decisions made and governance procedures.

Any interested parties who wish to join the ICAN Technical Committee should e-mail xxxxx@xxxxx.com
