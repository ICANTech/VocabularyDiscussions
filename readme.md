#ICAN Vocabulary Discussions#
##Introduction##
This Github repository is to allow discussion of various controlled vocabulary related topics by the International Coastal Atlas Network community.

Previous discussions, by e-mail, are in the process of being archived within this repository as markdown files to be rendered by GitHub.

New discussions should take place within the wiki space associated with this repository.

Once vocabulary governance rules are agreed by the ICAN Technical Committee, they will be posted here for transparency.
